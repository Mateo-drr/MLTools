# MLTools  
Collection of ML Blocks and Base Structures

## Implemented Blocks

### 1. **RepMode**
RepMode offers different dimensional modes for representing data within models:
  - **3D**: Original model.
  - **1D**: Added causal modification.

### 2. **Residual in Residual Dense Block**
A residual block structure that introduces skip connections within a dense block to improve gradient flow and feature reuse.
